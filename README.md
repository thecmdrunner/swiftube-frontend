# ℹ️ This is the repo for the now outdated alpha version. I'm working on the final release, which will be vastly better suited for production use!

# Swiftube

Swiftube is an innovative project that utilizes OpenAI and Remotion to transform content in text format, into polished explainer videos. It uses Google's text-to-speech feature to provide the voice for the video.

This project is built with a [**`create-t3-app`**](https://create.t3.gg/) for frontend and an Express server for the backend ([another repo](https://github.com/thecmdrunner/swiftube-backend)).

# Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using npm install.
3. Add a `.env` file to the root of the project and include the necessary environment variables.
4. Run the development server using npm run dev.
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to use the application.

## How it Works

Swiftube works by taking text input (prompt) from the user and utilizing OpenAI's APIs to generate talking points for the video. The script is then passed to Remotion, which generates the actual video with the help of Google's text-to-speech feature. The resulting video is then displayed to the user.
